#Meta Tic-Tac-Toe: Tic-Tac-Toe levelled up

We used to play this game in school that combined the simple fun of Tic-Tac-Toe with the strategy and forward thinking of a game like Chess. Some of our games took up to thirty minutes to close to an hour depending on how many grids we played on. The most basic gameboard is a 9x9 grid of 9x9 grids. I call it META TIC TAC TOE (if you think of a better name, pls let me know). It's been a great friend to the bored that was us at lunch (obviously at the cool table). Here is my attempt at coding the game to be playable on the internet.

Please feel free to change or condense the code to make it more elegant or minified. I'm thinking of adding crude A.I. at some point to make it playable for a single person, but for now it's strictly a two player game. Both the players have to be at the same computer to play. I'm also thinking of somehow implementing online play at some point (If you can do it, please fork the project and contribute). Shout out to [HackerYou](http://www.hackeryou.com) for providing the basic skeleton and giving me the idea to convert my basic Tic-Tac-Toe app into this more complex version.

##Rules

(I'll get to this soon)
