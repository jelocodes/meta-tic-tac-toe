#Meta Tic-Tac-Toe: Kinda like Tic-Tac-Toe meets Chess

We used to play this game in school that combined the simple fun of Tic-Tac-Toe with the strategy and forward thinking of a game like Chess. Some of our games took up to an hour or so. The gameboard is a 9x9 grid of 9x9 grids. I call it META TIC TAC TOE (if you think of a better name, please tell me). It's been a great friend to the bored that was us at lunch (obviously at the cool table). Here is my attempt at coding the game to be playable online.

Please feel free to change or condense the code to make it more elegant or minified. I'm thinking of adding crude A.I. at some point to make it playable for a single person, but for now it's strictly a two player (flesh and blood) game. Both the players have to be together to play. I'm also thinking of somehow implementing play through the internet (If you can do it, please fork the project and contribute).
